  # But in a longer unit of code such as a module it is wise to declare 
  # your variables both to catch typos and to constrain their 
  # accessibility appropriately from outside the module. The strict pragma
  # forces you to declare your variables.

  # A Perl module must end with a true value or else it is considered not to
